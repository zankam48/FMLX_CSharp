Here are practice exercises based on asynchronous programming in C#. These exercises vary in difficulty and cover multiple concepts in one practice when necessary. 🚀

🟢 Beginner-Level Exercises
1️⃣ Understanding Synchronous vs Asynchronous Execution
Practice:
Create two methods:
Synchronous: Waits for 3 seconds using Thread.Sleep(), then prints "Sync Done!".
Asynchronous: Waits for 3 seconds using Task.Delay(), then prints "Async Done!".
Call both methods and observe the difference.
✅ Goal: Understand how blocking and non-blocking execution work.

2️⃣ Writing Your First Async Method
Practice:
Write an async method called FetchDataAsync that:
Simulates a network call by using Task.Delay(2000).
Returns "Data received!".
In Main(), call FetchDataAsync and print the result.
✅ Goal: Understand async/await syntax and how async methods return values.

🟡 Intermediate-Level Exercises
3️⃣ Running Multiple Tasks in Parallel
Practice:
Write two async methods:
DownloadFileAsync(string fileName): Simulates downloading a file by waiting 3s (Task.Delay(3000)).
ProcessFileAsync(string fileName): Simulates processing a file by waiting 2s.
In Main(), call both methods in parallel using Task.WhenAll().
✅ Goal: Learn how to run multiple async tasks efficiently.

4️⃣ Using Continuations (ContinueWith)
Practice:
Create an async method ComputePrimesAsync(int count).
Use Task.Run() to compute prime numbers (simulate a long calculation).
Use .ContinueWith() to print the result after computation.
✅ Goal: Understand task continuations and how to chain async operations.

5️⃣ Handling I/O-Bound vs CPU-Bound Operations
Practice:
Create:
An I/O-bound async method (ReadFileAsync) that simulates reading a file (Task.Delay(2000)).
A CPU-bound method (CalculateFactorial(int n)) that computes factorial without async.
Run ReadFileAsync using await, but run CalculateFactorial(n) in Task.Run().
✅ Goal: Understand when to use async/await vs parallel tasks.

🟠 Advanced-Level Exercises
6️⃣ Implementing Cancellation in Async Operations
Practice:
Create an async method DownloadDataAsync(CancellationToken token), which:
Waits for 5 seconds (Task.Delay(5000)).
Stops immediately if cancellation is requested.
In Main(), start the download and cancel after 2 seconds.
✅ Goal: Learn how to cancel async tasks using CancellationToken.

7️⃣ Handling Timeouts with Task.WhenAny()
Practice:
Create an async method FetchUserDataAsync() that:
Simulates fetching user data (takes 5 seconds).
Use Task.WhenAny() to:
Wait for either the user data or a timeout of 3 seconds.
If the timeout wins, throw a TimeoutException.
✅ Goal: Learn how to handle timeouts efficiently in async programming.

8️⃣ Using async IAsyncEnumerable<> (Async Streams)
Practice:
Create an async generator GenerateNumbersAsync() that:
Yields numbers from 1 to 5, with a delay of 1 second between each.
Use await foreach to print each number as it becomes available.
✅ Goal: Learn how to handle async streams in C# 8+.

🔴 Expert-Level Challenges
9️⃣ Implementing a Task-Based Web Scraper
Practice:
Create an async method FetchWebDataAsync(string url):
Uses HttpClient to fetch data.
Returns the first 100 characters of the response.
Fetch 3 websites in parallel using Task.WhenAll().
✅ Goal: Apply real-world async programming for web requests.

🔟 Combining Async Tasks with Thread-Safety
Practice:
Create a shared counter variable.
Start two async tasks, each incrementing the counter 1000 times.
Use a lock or Interlocked.Increment() to prevent race conditions.
✅ Goal: Understand thread-safety in async tasks.

🚀 Bonus: Full-Project Challenge
Build an Async Stock Price Fetcher
Practice:
Create an async console app that:
Fetches stock prices from an API (simulate using Task.Delay()).
Cancels the request if it takes more than 5 seconds.
Uses async streams to continuously update stock prices every second.
✅ Goal: Build an async real-world application using all key async concepts!
